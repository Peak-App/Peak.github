# PEAK

Peak offers insights into the employee experience thorough crowdsourced company culture ratings and reviews. 

Unlike other review sites, Peak doesnâ€™t require users to subscribe or review their company in order to see other reviews. Reviews are available to all users.

# Problem Background
Job seekers hoping to learn about a company's culture must piece together as much information as they can by searching various places.

 Review sites like Glassdoor and Indeed, company websites, news articles, and even social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram help them understand the company culture but searching for information about perspective company culture is often vague and time-consuming.
